# Die Deutsche Programmiersprache (DDP)

DDP (german: The german programming language) is a (joke) programming language by NotLe0n and bafto, which was designed in such a way that programs written in it can be read like nearly correct German.

DDP belongs to a class of programming languages called "esoteric languages". The goal of such languages is not to be particularly efficient or simple, but to comment on the medium itself with their sometimes absurd syntax.

The source code of the compiler and this website can be found on [Github](https://github.com/DDP-Projekt).
