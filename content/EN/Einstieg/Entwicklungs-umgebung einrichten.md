# Set up development environment

In order to write and compile programs in DDP, it is actually enough to have the compiler installed and use it via the command line.
However, we still recommend using one of the many text editors that are intended for programming, as these offer many advantages over pre-installed text editors and there are plugins/extensions to adapt them to the programming language.
If you don't want/need an editor, you can continue with the step [Installation](/Bedienungsanleitung/en/Einstieg/Installation).

At the moment DDP only supports [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with an official extension.
However, there is a language server for DDP, called [DDPLS](https://github.com/DDP-Projekt/DDPLS). This makes it possible to use many features independently of the editor. If you want, you can use DDPLS to write extensions or plugins for editors other than VSCode.

## Visual Studio Code Download

You can find the Visual Studio Code download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
Simply download the installer for your system and follow its instructions.

If you use Visual Studio Code you should also download the official extension [vscode-ddp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DDP-Projekt.vscode-ddp) directly into VSCode.
