# Functions

Functions are an important concept encountered in almost every programming language.
They are used to group sections of code that are commonly used, make larger programs more readable, and break code into meaningful sections.

In DDP, functions are used in the same way as in other languages, but the priority here is readability (which is the goal of the language), so DDP has a unique way of using functions in the form of aliases.

Functions are also important for using APIs and libraries of operating systems or other languages, because they provide a way to talk to C code, allowing access to e.g. the WinAPI or many graphics libraries.

In general, functions are a central part of DDP programming and must not be overlooked.
